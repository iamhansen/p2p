        Summary
      </h2>
      <p class="body summary">

        Usage
      </h2>
      <div class="content usage">
        Using a BitTorrent <a>client</a> (or the original one) originally comprised of
        <ul>
          <li>A Client</li>
          <li>A .torrent file</li>
          <li>A Tracker Server</li>
        </ul>
        However, in newer clients, it is able to use MAGNET links as a replacement for .torrent files,
        <br> and Distrubuted Hash Tables, Local Peer Discovery, and Peer Exchange. (DHT, LPD, PEX)
        <br>
        <br> Using BitTorrent you join a 'swarm' of computers that download/upload to each other.
        <br> To share a file, the person sharing at first must make a torrent file, which can be made by their BitTorrent client.
        <br> The torrent file consists of metadata to find and reassemble the file.
        <br>
        <br> The metadata is the title of the torrent, trackers to use, list of files, comments, piece size & hashes, info hash, and miscellaneous info. (comments, other torrents, source)
        <br> When sharing files with BitTorrent, the client is uploading/downloading segments of the file called pieces.
        <br> The file is segmented into equal sized (usually from 32kb to 16mb) pieces.
        <br>Due to this segmentation, any torrent download can be paused and restarted without much data loss.
        <br>Each piece has their own hash to be stored in the torrent file with all the other metadata.
        <br>This is to easily check for any modifications of the file to prevent accidental or malicious data from being sent to others.
